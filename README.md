# NodeMCU-V3-2.8-TFT-LCD-Shield-
    
    ESP8266 NodeMCU v3 from AZDelivery and TFT LCD SHIELD from ELEGOO
    
    SD CARD READER IS NOT CONECTED DUE TO NodeMCU HAS NOT NECESARY NUMBER OF PINS (i think on ESP32 u can connect all, will be the next project)

  -First of all u must have installed Arduino IDE
  
      link to Arduino IDE : https://www.arduino.cc/en/software                 

  -Install CH413xDriver that is on this repository (This is for arduino IDE recognize the chipset NodeMCU v3)
  
  -Install .zip libraries (Read the PDF of How to instal .zip libraries if you dont know how install it, also added the user manual from TFT for diagrams and more connections, but THE MANUAL  IS FOR ARDUINO UNO OR MEGA NOT FOR ESP8266 NOR ESP32)
 
  -Conect wires like images 
 
 -Copy the code on the Arduino IDE & flash it (is a tft lcd test program , the important is the setup for conection)
    
  -Run it
